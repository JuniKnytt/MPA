Love playing with lots of friends? Hate fighting over items and mob grinding?


Multiplayer Progression Assist is a crafting mod that adds in balanced crafting recipes for items that are practically
essential for progressing in the game. The main idea is to bring in all the vanilla craftable items in Calamity,
like craftable Hermes boots, cloud in a bottle, etc, and add them into a standalone mod with an emphasis on balancing.

Big thanks to all who helped make this quality of life mod a reality.
